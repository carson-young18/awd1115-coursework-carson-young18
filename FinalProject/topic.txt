My project proposal is a web application for the Runescape video game. Users will be able to create unique accounts for the site, and then will be able 
to add Runescape accounts to their tracker in order to see it's activity history. Users can monitor any Runescape account, even ones already being tracked,
making the Runescape accounts database one-to-many. Activities that are gathered via the Runescape API will be stored and will be unique to the Runescape
account being tracked, creating a one-to-one relationship. Users will be able to create and update their application accounts, and add or delete which
Runescape accounts they are tracking on their profile. The site will validate that a Runescape account exists before attempting to track it, as well as
validating the info used to create user accounts. State will be used to keep users logged in upon return to the site.
